/*
 * CD-XA music (Sonic CD docs/ports/sonic-cd/28 phase 5.2; Sonic 2 docs/ports/sonic-2/30 phase 5.2; Mania docs/ports/mania/32 phase 5.2): plays one track of Data/Music/Music.xa (tools/audio/build_music.py)
 * through the CD drive's XA-ADPCM decoder into the SPU's CD input. No CPU decoding, no SPU RAM.
 * Sonic CD: 68 tracks in 8 channels, back to back per channel; a track starts at its start row, loops
 * at its loop row (the script's loop point, row-aligned at build time) and ends at its end marker.
 *
 * A long-lived psyqo::CDRomDevice::Action (raw commands, like ps1/cdrom_stream.cpp):
 * Setloc -> Setfilter(1, channel) -> Setmode(2x | XA-ADPCM | 2340-byte sectors | filter) ->
 * ReadS. Audio sectors never reach the CPU; data sectors do (INT1): each is DMA'd into a small
 * buffer, and the track's end-marker sector (channel + track id) either loops the track
 * (Setloc to the loop row + ReadS) or pauses.
 * One CD action at a time: stop the music before any file read (cdrom_fs does it as a safety
 * net and counts it).
